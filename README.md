# CS-470-Fullstack-Development-II
Part of the course was a video presentation that summarized what we learned using the cloud application project we completed earlier. The video is unlisted on YouTube but a link to view it is in the PDF file uploaded to this repository.

Because the project revolved around migrating an application to the cloud via AWS, we were warned that it would be a security risk to upload files associated with AWS. As such only one of two projects will be uploaded here, the final reflection and video.
